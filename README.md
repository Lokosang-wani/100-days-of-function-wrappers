# 100 Days of Function Wrappers ðŸš€

This is my personal **100 Days of Code** challenge focused on building one **JavaScript function wrapper** every day.

A *function wrapper* is a higher-order function that takes another function and adds extra behavior â€” like logging, validation, error handling, or performance optimization â€” without changing the original function's code.

Over these 100 days, I'll start with **beginner-friendly** wrappers (like logging) and gradually progress to **advanced** ones (like caching, retries, throttling, and API helpers).
